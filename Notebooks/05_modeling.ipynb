    "This next step requires some careful thought. We want to refit the model using all available data. But should we include Big Mountain data? On the one hand, we are _not_ trying to estimate model performance on a previously unseen data sample, so theoretically including Big Mountain data should be fine. One might first think that including Big Mountain in the model training would, if anything, improve model performance in predicting Big Mountain's ticket price. But here's where our business context comes in. The motivation for this entire project is based on the sense that Big Mountain needs to adjust its pricing. One way to phrase this problem: we want to train a model to predict Big Mountain's ticket price based on data from _all the other_ resorts! We don't want Big Mountain's current price to bias this. We want to calculate a price based only on its competitors."

Ticket price is not determined by any set of parameters; the resort is free to set whatever price it likes. However, the resort operates within a market where people pay more for certain facilities, and less for others. Being able to sense how facilities support a given ticket price is valuable business intelligence. This is where the utility of our model comes in.\n",

    "3. Same as number 2, but adding 2 acres of snow making cover\n",

What does your modelling suggest for a ticket price that could be supported in the marketplace by Big Mountain's facilities? How would you approach suggesting such a change to the business leadership? Discuss the additional operating cost of the new chair lift per ticket (on the basis of each visitor on average buying 5 day tickets) in the context of raising prices to cover this. For future improvements, state which, if any, of the modeled scenarios you'd recommend for further consideration. Suggest how the business might test, and progress, with any run closures."

You were provided with information about the additional operating cost of the new chair lift, but what other cost information would be useful? Big Mountain was already fairly high on some of the league charts of facilities offered, but why was its modeled price so much higher than its current price? Would this mismatch come as a surprise to the business executives? How would you find out? Assuming the business leaders felt this model was useful, how would the business make use of it? Would you expect them to come to you every time they wanted to test a new combination of parameters in a scenario? We hope you would have better things to do, so how might this model be made available for business analysts to use and explore?"
